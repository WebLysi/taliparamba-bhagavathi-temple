    content: `It has been revealed through Ashtamangalya Swarnaprashna Chinta (an astrological/divination method) that a Bhadrakali temple, which was worshipped by the Perur Illam family of Kodallur from ancient times, existed on this sacred land (Arudham).

Taliparamba Sree Bhagavathi Temple, located close to the heart of Taliparamba town, is a center of worship where rituals are performed according to Tantric traditions, following both Bhuthalaya (spirit/elemental abode) and Devalaya (deity abode) systems.

However, over time, this temple fell into disrepair, and later, our ancestors settled on the same land, continuing to worship and perform rituals according to the Bhuthalaya system.

Centuries ago, our ancestors (Chathangattillam) consecrated Parokkavil Bhagavathi, the deity of Kunnaru Desam near Ramanthali, on this sacred land. Currently, she is worshipped in the Thekkepalliyara (Southern Shrine) according to the Devalaya system.

Until the dilapidated Bhadrakali temple can be renovated, the current practice here is to perform a special Padmam (ritualistic drawing) puja for Bhadrakali as part of the annual festival.
